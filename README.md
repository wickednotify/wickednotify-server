# WickedNotify - Send notifications to all of your user's devices at once!
WickedNotify exposes a simple WebSocket API to register your user's iOS devices to receive notifications by simply inserting into a PostgreSQL table.

It also allows arbitrary devices (like Android) to receive notifications through WebSockets.

#### SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
WickedNotify is well tested on Linux, but works well on macOS. It also should work on *BSD, but it hasn't been specifically tested.

WickedNotify does not support Windows, and support is not planned.

#### INSTALLING WICKEDNOTIFY
See INSTALL.md for instructions.

#### FEEDBACK AND BUG REPORTS
Please contact us with your feedback! Github issues and pull requests are welcome. Please report any issues you have for support.

## Roadmap
